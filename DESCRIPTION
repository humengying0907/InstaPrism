Title: Fast implementaion of cell type and gene expression deconvolution
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Mengying Hu, Maria Chikina
Maintainer: Mengying <mhu5304@gmail.com>
Description: InstaPrism is R package to deconvolute cellular proportion and gene expression in bulk RNA-Seq data. It is based on a Bayesian inference model from BayesPrism. InstaPrism provides fast implementation of the deconvolution module from BayesPrism: it replaces the time-consuming gibbs sampling steps in BayesPrism with a fixed-point algorithm that greatly accelerated the calculation speed while maintaining similar performance as BayesPrism.
